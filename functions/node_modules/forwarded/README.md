Parse HTTP X-Forwarded-For header

## Installation

This is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) module available through the
[npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/). Installation is done using the
[`npm install` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally):

```sh
$ npm install forwarded
```

## API

```js
var forwarded = require('forwarded')
```

### forwarded(req)

```js
var addresses = forwarded(req)
```

Parse the `X-Forwarded-For` header from the request. Returns an array
of the addresses, including the socket address for the `req`, in reverse
order (i.e. index `0` is the socket address and the last index is the
furthest address, typically the end-user).
